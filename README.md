Introduction

We would like to mimic a working prototype of Facebook feed.

Core Functionalities:
1. User login -- Authentication via Fb/Google oAuth.
2. Create, Update, Delete Feed
3. Ability for other users to create, update and delete comments on a feed
4. Users should be able to configure their profile
5. Admin module where available users and their activities can be seen

Bonus:
1. Users to invite other users i.e. send other users a friend request
2. Ability for Ads to run. These ads will be configured by the administrator

Application Configuration:
1. Spring Boot Backend
2. Web Application in Angular. The web app must be responsive i.e. regardless of what screen we see it, we must see the UI elements in a nice manner.
3. Design the services using micro service architecture.
4. Use in memory database H2 or a locally setup MySql is good too.
5. We want to see a well organized, properly unit tested code.
6. Maintain a separate folder under resources to document all DDL and DMLs
7. Create a postman project with a separate folder to test APIs
8. UI/Mobile app MUST communicate to the backend via a JWT token (Spring Security)

Timeline:
- The assignment is expected to take about 1-2 weeks to complete but if you can finish it within a week it'll be an extra credit but totally optional.

Acceptance:
- Code must be present in your Github account with proper documentation on how to use it.
- Once you finish the assignment, share the link of the code and send us an email to schedule a 2 hour interview to review and assess.

This will be the final technical round and we'll then move on the the last phase of the interview.

Please do not hesitate to reach out to us if you have any questions.

Note: Show your creativity by designing the software in as much user friendly way as possible.
Document all your assumption.

We wish you the best for the next round of the interviews.
