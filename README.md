POC for Managing Feeds (Angular version 10)

1. Users should be able to create/delete a feed  
2. Friends should be able to like and comment on a feed  
3. There will be 2 screen for the logged in user  
a) My Feeds - This is where user will be able to see all his feeds
b) Home Page - Logged in user will be able to see his + friends feeds
